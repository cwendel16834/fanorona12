Git workflow:

1. Make sure your master branch is up to date. Hit F5 to refresh and sync if necessary.
2. Create a local branch on which to make your changes. This does not need to be published to the server.
3. Make your changes to the project while on the local branch.
4. Ensure that the project still compiles as a .dll in Visual Studio.
5. Commit changes to local branch.
6. Merge your local branch into the master branch. Make sure it says Master in the output box.
7. Sync the master branch with the server.
8. Delete local branch.
